# 📊 Brazilian E-Commerce Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes a real-world dataset from a Brazilian e-commerce platform (Olist) to uncover business insights such as customer behavior, sales trends, delivery performance, and more. The analysis uses **Python (Pandas, SQL), Power BI**, and **PostgreSQL** for a complete data analytics workflow.
